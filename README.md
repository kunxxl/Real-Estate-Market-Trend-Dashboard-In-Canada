# Real-Estate-Market-Trend-Dashboard-In-Canada
Real-world real estate market dashboard developed during my internship as a Research &amp; Property Analyst at eXp Realty. The project involved collecting, cleaning, and analyzing market data using Google Sheets and building interactive visualizations in Looker Studio to track sales, listings, inventory, and city-wise trends.
